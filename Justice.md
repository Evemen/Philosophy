# Harvard - Justice: What's the right thing to do

## Lecture 1: Doing the right thing

### Moral Reasoning

Two principles

- Moral Consequentialist
  - Locates morality in the consequences of an act (most influential example: utilitarianism功利主义 English political philosopher: Jeremy Bentham)比如根据车最终撞死的人数来（牺牲少数）判断是否道德。
- Categorical
  - Locates morality in certain duties and rights (German Philosopher: Emmanuel Kant)，比如根据受害者的权利和是否有知情权（rights and consent)来判断是否道德。

## Lecture 2: The lifeboat case

To simplify things, put aside the question of law and assume that you were asked to decide whether killing the cabin boy was morally permissible.



Is morality a matter of counting lives and weighing costs and benefits, or are certain moral duties and human rights so fundamental that they rise above such calculations?

## Lecture 3: Utilitarinism: Jeremy Bentham

Cost-benefit analysis examples: Smoking, Ford Pinto Car



### Objections to Utilitarianism

1. Fails to respect individual / minority rights
2. Not possible to aggregate all values and preferences
   - Using a single measure like $$
   - Isn't there a distinction between higher and lower pleasures?



## Lecture 4: Utilitarianism: J.S. Mill

 *Jeremy Bentham’s (1748-1832) principle of utility is open to the objection that it may well sacrifice the rights of the minority for the sake of the happiness of the majority. John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), himself a utilitarian, sought to rescue utilitarianism from this and other objections. In his essay Utilitarianism, Mill argues that respect for individual rights as “the most sacred and binding part of morality” is compatible with the idea that justice rests ultimately on utilitarian considerations.* 

Mill's essay: Utilitarianism.



## Lecture 5: Libertarianism: Free Market Philosophy

The libertarian view of government:

1. No paternalist legislation
2. No Morals legislation
3. No redistribution of income from rich to poor



The example of taxation: Tax over the rich can be considered as forced labor and thus make the rich somewhat a slave. 



## Lecture 6: Libertarianism: Do we own ourselves?



Those who favor the redistribution of income through taxation of- fer various objections to the libertarian logic. Most of these objections can be answered.

- Objection 1:Taxation is not as bad as forced labor.

If you are taxed, you can always choose to work less and pay lower taxes; but if you are forced to labor, you have no such choice.

Libertarian reply: Well, yes. But why should the state force you to make that choice? 

- Objection 2:The poor need the money more.

Libertarian reply: Maybe so. But this is a reason to persuade the affluent to support the needy through their own free choice.

- Objection 3: Michael Jordan doesn’t play alone. He therefore owes a debt to those who contribute to his success.

Libertarian reply: But these people have already been paid the market value of their services. 

- Objection 4: Jordan is not really being taxed without his consent.As a citizen of a democracy,he has a voice in making the tax laws to which he is subject.

Libertarian reply: Democratic consent is not enough.

You might argue that by living in this society, Jordan gives his consent (at least implicitly) to abide by the majority’s will and obey the laws. 

But does this mean that simply by living here as citizens, we write the majority a blank check, and con- sent in advance to all laws, however unjust?

- Objection 5: Jordan is lucky.

Libertarian reply:This objection questions whether Jordan’s talents are really his. But this line of argument is potentially dangerous. If Jordan is not entitled to the benefits that result from the exercise of his tal- ents, then he doesn’t really own them. And if he doesn’t own his talents and skills, then he doesn’t really own himself. But if Jordan doesn’t own himself, who does? Are you sure you want to attribute to the po- litical community a property right in its citizens?

The notion of self-ownership is appealing, especially for those who seek a strong foundation for individual rights.The idea that I belong to myself, not to the state or political community, is one way of explain- ing why it is wrong to sacrifice my rights for the welfare of others.

- Libertarianism

The idea that we own ourselves figures in many arguments for free- dom of choice. If I own my body, my life, and my person, I should be free to do whatever I want with them (provided I don’t harm others). Despite the appeal of this idea, its full implications are not easy to embrace.

If you are tempted by libertarian principles and want to see how far you would take them, consider these cases:

Selling kidneys

Assisted suicide

Consensual cannibalism
